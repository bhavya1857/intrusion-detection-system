# intrusion-detection-system
Leveraged machine learning techniques to develop a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of accurately distinguishing between malicious and legitimate network traffic. By applying feature extraction on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, I constructed a predictive model that effectively identifies potential security threats.
